What Distinguishes Binary Tree, Balanced Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, and Other Binary Trees From Each Other?

A binary tree is a tree data structure where 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗻𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗻𝗼 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝘁𝘄𝗼 𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗿𝗲𝗻.

A binary tree can come in many forms, such as the following:

𝗙𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗲: every node has either zero or two children.

𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲 𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗲: each level of the tree has a complete set of nodes, with the last level being the exception.

𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗲: Every level of the tree including the last level is complete.

𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗲: the depth of the left and right sub-trees of all nodes differ by no more than 1.

𝗕𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗲: each node is larger than all the nodes in their left sub-tree, and smaller than all the nodes in their right sub-tree.

Binary trees are great for 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. Their strict structure and properties make these tasks highly efficient.

Some typical use cases are:

🔸 Search algorithms
🔸 Sort algorithms
🔸 Pathfinding algorithms
🔸 Representation of hierarchical data

𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀 are often used to implement binary trees because of their ability to use 𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗮𝗽𝘀𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗯𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.

𝗔 𝗡𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗹𝗲𝗳𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗱. An insert function would be used to add a value relative to a given root node. Based on the binary tree type, it may need to travel through the tree to find its appropriate position. Based on your use case, you may want to have other methods like search and traverse.

Binary trees are integral to programming. They provide an essential building block for developing efficient algorithms and programs.
