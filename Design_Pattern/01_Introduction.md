# Design Pattern Interview Questions and Answers
# SOLID Design Pattern Interview Questions and Answers

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

### 1. 
**Q:** What is the Single Responsibility Principle?

**A:** The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should only have one responsibility or job.

### 2. 
**Q:** How does adhering to SRP benefit software design?

**A:** Adhering to SRP improves code maintainability by isolating changes related to different concerns. It also promotes code reuse and makes classes more focused and easier to understand.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

### 3. 
**Q:** Explain the Open/Closed Principle.

**A:** The Open/Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. It encourages the use of interfaces and abstract classes to allow new functionality to be added without altering existing code.

### 4. 
**Q:** Provide an example of how you can implement the Open/Closed Principle in a real-world scenario.

**A:** One can use interfaces and abstract classes to define contracts and allow for extension through inheritance. Adding new functionality can be achieved by creating new classes that implement existing interfaces.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

### 5. 
**Q:** What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?

**A:** The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a derived class should extend but not replace the behavior of its base class.

### 6. 
**Q:** How do you ensure adherence to the Liskov Substitution Principle?

**A:** To adhere to LSP, subclasses must maintain the behavioral expectations of the superclass. This often involves careful consideration of method signatures, preconditions, and postconditions.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

### 7. 
**Q:** Explain the Interface Segregation Principle.

**A:** The Interface Segregation Principle states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. It encourages the creation of specific, client-focused interfaces rather than large, general-purpose interfaces.

### 8. 
**Q:** How does ISP promote better design?

**A:** ISP promotes better design by avoiding situations where a class is forced to implement methods it doesn't need. It leads to more modular and maintainable code by allowing clients to depend only on the methods they use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

### 9. 
**Q:** What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?

**A:** The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. It also advocates that abstractions should not depend on details but rather the other way around.

### 10. 
**Q:** How can Dependency Injection be used to implement DIP?

**A:** Dependency Injection involves injecting dependencies (usually through constructor injection) rather than having a class create its dependencies. This adheres to DIP by allowing high-level modules to depend on abstractions and receive concrete implementations at runtime.

## Creational Design Patterns:

### 1. Singleton Pattern:
#### 
**Q:** Explain the Singleton design pattern and when would you use it?

**A:** The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system, such as a configuration manager or a logging service.

### 2. Factory Method Pattern:
#### 
**Q:** What is the Factory Method pattern?

**A:** The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating the instance in a method called by a factory class. It provides an interface for creating instances of a class but allows the subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### 3. Abstract Factory Pattern:
#### 
**Q:** How does the Abstract Factory pattern differ from the Factory Method pattern?

**A:** The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's one level of abstraction higher than the Factory Method pattern, which deals with creating a single object.

## Structural Design Patterns:

### 4. Adapter Pattern:
#### 
**Q:** Explain the Adapter design pattern.

**A:** The Adapter pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

### 5. Decorator Pattern:
#### 
**Q:** What is the Decorator pattern?

**A:** The Decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### 6. Composite Pattern:
#### 
**Q:** Describe the Composite design pattern.

**A:** The Composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is used when clients need to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.

## Behavioral Design Patterns:

### 7. Observer Pattern:
#### 
**Q:** What is the Observer design pattern?

**A:** The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. It is often used for implementing distributed event handling systems.

### 8. Strategy Pattern:
#### 
**Q:** Explain the Strategy design pattern.

**A:** The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

### 9. Command Pattern:
#### 
**Q:** How does the Command pattern work?

**A:** The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby parameterizing clients with queues, requests, and operations. It allows for the support of undoable operations and decouples the sender and receiver of a request.

## Other Design Patterns:

### 10. MVC Pattern:
#### 
**Q:** What is the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern?

**A:** The MVC pattern separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (presentation layer), and the Controller (handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly). It promotes a clean separation of concerns.

### 11. Singleton vs. Static Class:
#### 
**Q:** What is the difference between a Singleton pattern and a static class?

**A:** A Singleton allows only one instance of a class to be created and provides a global point of access to it. A static class cannot be instantiated and is used for grouping related methods and properties together.

### 12. Observer vs. Publish-Subscribe:
#### 
**Q:** What is the difference between the Observer pattern and the Publish-Subscribe pattern?

**A:** The Observer pattern involves a subject and multiple observers, where the subject maintains a list of dependents (observers) that are notified of state changes. Publish-Subscribe, on the other hand, uses a message broker to manage subscribers and publishers without them being directly aware of each other.
